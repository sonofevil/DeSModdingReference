These files are versions of the loose .lua files found in Demon's Souls "script" directory, but with added English translations appended as comments to each line containing Japanese text.

Translations are prefixed with `--EN:`.

These translations were generated using bash scripting and google translate. Therefore I cannot guarantee completeness, accuracy, or that the files are syntactically correct will work in the actual game (loose .lua files aren't read by vanilla DeS anyway, they have to be packaged and encrypted into .luabnd.dcx.sdat files). However, at the point of uploading to GitHub, they are correctly encoded with "sjis" character encoding (rather than utf-8), as are the original files.
