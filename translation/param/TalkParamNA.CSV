10500#what to do
10501#Buzz cut bastard
10600#dead
10700#Where are you looking
10800#Interruption of conversation
10900#thanks
29100#Above this castle gate
29101#Open quickly
29110#Hurry up
29120#thank you somehow
11100#Please! Help me! I am trapped; surrounded by dreglings!
11110#My thanks for your brave rescue.
11111#I am Ostrava of Boletaria. \nAccept this as a token of my gratitude.
11120#Now, I must go. There is something for me to take care of.
11130#That was a bold jump! A surprise indeed!
11131#Well, now that you are here, \npray thee, fend off these dreglings
11140#No matter how far I venture, only the soul-starved remain.
11141#Is there a single sane person left in Boletaria?
11200#Hello! You yonder! Over here! It's me, Ostrava!
11201#Look at me, again surrounded by evil warriors.\nCould you, perhaps, help me one last time?
11202#Clear out the soldiers at the far end of this passage, \nif it pleases you.
11203#The Lord's Path, just down yonder, has degenerated \ninto a feeding ground for flying dragons. \nHave your wits about you.
11210#Thank you. That makes twice.
11211#Thanks to you, I can now forge ahead.\nThis is a token of my gratitude. Please accept it.
11221#This is bad... Not a single person left... Why on Earth...?
11222#How did all of this happen...Father!
11300#Help! Helppp!
11301#Soul-starved soldiers are after me! \nIn the name of all that is sacred, please open this gate!
11302#Oh Lord, hurry, please! They are almost upon me!
11310#Thank you for rescuing me.
11320#A dead-end?
11321#No! Help me!
11322#I'll never make it! I'll be killed!
11330#You saved my life.
11331#This is the third time. I am truly indebted to you.
11332#This is... all I have, but please accept it.
11333#Now, I must go. \nMy father the King awaits me just over there.
11340#My father the King awaits me just over there.
11400#Oh, it's you, is it?
11401#My father is up above.
11402#Well, what's left of him, anyway.\nHe's transformed into a fiendish Demon.
11403#I began this quest in a search for truth, \nbut it seems I was a fool to even try.
11404#Please kill my father. \nIn his degenerated state, \nhe can only bring peril to the lands.
11405#This key... fits the Boletaria mausoleum.
11406#Inside the mausoleum are my father's two swords, \nSoulbrandt and Demonbrandt.
11407#Use them to bring an end to this madness.
11410#What on earth are you doing?!
11411#Please, you must not! I thought we were allies!
11415#What on earth are you doing?!
11420#Please, wait a while!
11421#You are running off to where?
11430#What was the hurry just now?
11431#Surely you can spare a mere moment.
11500#Here in Boletaria, \nwe speak of the legend of The Two Swords and\nThe Last Hero.
11501#The Two Swords are Demonbrandt and Soulbrandt.
11502#One sword banishes that which befouls man, \nand the other banishes man himself.
11503#The Last Hero is old King Doran.
11504#King Doran is the Everlasting One, founder of Boletaria, \nand protector of the Two Swords.
11505#Hah hah, of course, only according to legend!
11506#But in the dark state of our land, \nlegends are all we can depend upon...
11510#At its peak, Boletaria was a grand kingdom.
11511#The king, his knights, \nand his subjects were modest and plain, \nbut also steadfast and compassionate.
11512#In the distant southern kingdom, \nBoletaria was known as paradise on earth.
11513#But look at what has become of us now!
11514#I refuse to believe that \nthis is what Father wished for our great land...
11520#King Allant led Boletaria with \na round table of brave knights.
11521#The royal Twin Fangs, Vallarfax and Biorr,
11522#Alfred, the knight of the tower, \nMetas, the knight of the lance,
11523#and the brave tribesman Long Bow Oolan \nand his fearsome legions.
11524#But today Boletaria is an abysmal mess.
11525#Vallarfax was lost, \nand Biorr slipped through the fissure, \nnever to be heard from again.
11526#All the rest, along with Boletaria, \nhave been devoured by the fog, \nand will soon be prey to the Demons.
11527#The Boletarian knights are no longer.
11528#But perhaps our age will see the rise of new heroes, \nsuch as yourself.
11530#What on earth are you doing?!
11531#Please, you must not! I thought we were allies!
11540#Please, wait a while!
11541#You are running off to where?
11550#What was the hurry just now?
11551#Surely you can spare a mere moment.
12000#Good day to you. Care to look over me wares?
12001#Mostly stolen, but who's telling, eh?
12010#Thanks for that. Come back soon.
12020#Go ahead, take your time.
12021#I'm not going anywhere. Heh heh heh.
12030#Ah, we meet again. Fancy that.
12031#Hope you find something that suits you.
12040#Hello, what can I do for you?
12050#Thanks for that.
12060#Be you brave knight or depraved slave, \nthe Demons will snatch your soul, \nthen you'll go mad.
12061#And those who dare cling to their humanity are hunted down.
12062#It is the end of Great Boletaria as we know it.
12063#But hell, at least the Demons don't send us to our\ndeaths in battle! Heh heh heh heh.
12070#There's this skinny fellow, clad in fabulous armour, \nwho is always mumbling about some mission.
12071#He's another one who's managed to stay sane like yourself.
12072#Probably some pampered son, by the looks of his attire.
12073#I'd give an arm just for the buttons off his shirt!
12080#The King? He's gone mad like the rest of them.
12081#Or perhaps he was mad in the first place. \nI can never tell with those eccentric royal oafs!
12090#The giant lizard?
12091#One of the King's pets, just like those Demons.
12092#That monster leaves a trail of charred carcasses. \nWhich is great for business, of course!
12093#But unless you're a scavenger like me, \nyou'd better stay clear. Heh heh heh.
12100#What the devil's wrong with you!
12102#I'm not afraid! I'll tear you limb from limb!
12110#Hard times, eh?
12111#I'm sure you'll turn things around. Heh heh heh.
12120#Hold it, friend! Going so soon?
12130#Go on. Treat yourself to something.
13000#Who goes there!
13001#Have I been freed?
13002#Ah!
13003#Mmmmmmnnn... Ah-hah! \nThat vile insect, I shall tear him limb from limb!
13010#You obsequious larvae!
13011#Grovelling soul-starved abomination!
13020#Hm? Who are you?...Ah, you're the one who saved me.
13021#I am called Biorr, the elder of the Twin Fangs\nof Boletaria. I thank you.
13022#You deserve a handsome reward. Only I have none! \nGahahahahah...
13023#I'm going to sleep. Go on ahead.
13030#Hmmmggggggg...
13040#Do you need some help?
13041#By the honour of the good knights!
13042#This demonic folly shall be stopped once and for all!
13045#One more Demon down!
13046#Gahahahahahah!
13050#Do you need some help?
13051#Leave the flying lizard to me!
13052#May light shine upon our Lord and our proud Boletaria!
13060#Boletariaaaa!
13061#Gahahahahahah!
13070#Where are you going?
13071#Why the rush? Off to save the world? Gahahahah.
13080#Hrggk!
13081#What the...! What has possessed you?!
13082#I may be old, but I'm not frail!
13085#Hrggk!
13500#Our great King is a magnanimous leader.
13501#He is stolid, spirited, caring of his subjects. \nHe fought vigilantly against the vile and depraved.
13502#The seditious claims that our Lord brought \nthis scourge upon us--they are mere fabrications\nwoven by jealous conspirators.
13503#I am certain of it, for there is no other explanation.
13510#My brother-in-arms, Vallarfax of the Twin Fangs,\nwas a brave and mighty knight.
13511#Unlike myself, he was the master of more than the sword. \nVallarfax's mind was sharper than most scholars.
13512#Dark times have befallen us. If our Lord, with the\nesteemed help of Vallarfax, could not prevent it...
13513#Then no one could have.
13520#Who goes there!
13521#Ah, you killed that vile insect, and saved me, heheh.
13522#I am called Biorr, the elder of the Twin Fangs\nof Boletaria. I thank you.
13523#You deserve a handsome reward. Only I have none! \nGahahahahah...
13524#Go on ahead. I shall sleep a while.
13530#Fine work back there.
13531#Then again, how could a Demon ever stand up\nto a bona fide knight? Gahahahahah...
13532#Now, you go on ahead. \nI must be getting older. I need some rest.
13540#We managed, did we? That leaping lizard was\nmore trouble than expected.
13541#Now, you go on ahead. You know me; I need a nap...
13542#That swooping monstrosity... was quite a drain on me...
13550#I heard an odd piece of news from a merchant dregling...
13551#He claims that the son of the King, \nAriona, has come to Boletaria alone.
13552#Ariona is a wise and kind soul, almost too kind; \nhe would not be safe in this accursed land\nwithout protection.
13553#If you find Ariona, do look after him, \nand tell him to return to the Nexus immediately...
13554#And that Biorr of the Twin Fangs will\nlook after His Highness.
13560#Do you intend to challenge the King?
13561#You may be a great Demon hunter, \nbut I fear you may not be ready.
13562#The King is defended by the black souls of mighty knights, \nand a fire-breathing dragon.
13563#They defeated even myself; \nthat's how I ended up in the dungeon.
13564#Beware the limits of your own power.
13570#Hmm, you've seen the lone stone tower that \nsprouts forth from the outer wall of Boletaria castle?
13571#According to that spineless warden, a young sorceress\nis held prisoner there, where she is subject to, um, \nall manner of untold acts in the name of purification.
13572#Regrettably, I cannot find my way into that tower.
13573#How long will those vermin dishonour the King's good name?
13580#Ah, hello there.
13581#You rescued the young sorceress from that tower!
13582#I express my gratitude. There can be no excuse for\nsuch ill treatment of a young innocent.
13583#The King would be proud.
13590#Where are you going?
13591#Why the rush? Off to save the world? Gahahahah.
13600#Hrggk!
13601#What the...! What has possessed you?!
13602#I may be old, but I'm not frail!
13605#Hrggk!
14000#...What do you want with me?
14001#...Have you brutes no mercy...?
14002#Do as you wish.
14003#There are no secrets here; only a tired, emaciated frame.
14005#...What do you want with me?
14010#Heavens, you...
14011#You... you came to... save me?
14012#Thank you. No, I'm fine.
14013#With a little rest, I can soon walk.
14016#You go on ahead. I do not wish to be a dead weight.
14500#Hello again. You saved me from great agony.
14501#I am sorry, for I cannot offer proper thanks.
14502#If you wish, however, I can teach you magic\nin trade for Demon souls.
14503#But my witchcraft is of a dark nature, \nand arouses suspicions.
14504#Why not try the magic of great Sage Freke?
14506#Perhaps it would not fit you...
14510#Are you certain you wish to learn witchcraft?
14511#It would honour me to assist one such as you, but...
14512#Are you sure?
14520#Are you here for more witchcraft?
14521#Very well. I shall help you however I can.
14530#I owe my life to you.
14531#If you are ever in need of witchcraft, speak to me.
14532#It is a dark art, but it is all that I can offer.
14540#I feel great misgivings about Freke.
14541#I was branded a witch at a very young age, and since then, \nI have been persecuted as a threat to human society.
14542#Although I never had ill intentions, \nthis black craft of mine is intrinsically evil.
14543#If there is a God, he gave us souls to do good, \nnot to practise witchcraft.
14544#My accusers detested my dark arts for good reason, \nfor the path I have taken is tainted.
14545#This has been one of my realizations \nsince coming to Boletaria.
14546#But I am afraid that Freke, too, has ventured down\nthe wrong path. He has become obsessed with the\ndark arts.
14550#Once, I lusted after the power offered by Demon souls.
14551#I ventured through the fissure into Boletaria, \nbut became trapped in the Nexus.
14552#Then, the King's executioner, Miralda, chained \nme up inside that tower.
14553#My thirst for Demon souls is no more.
14554#On the contrary, I find such power dangerous.
14560#Do you know Yurt, the silent chief?
14561#He dons pitch black armour, \nand a helmet with two sharp spikes.
14562#Yurt's presence in Boletaria has resulted in the\ndeath of many a great hero.
14563#Whatever his motives may be, he is a grave danger to us all.
14564#Do watch out for him. \nI cannot bear to think of harm coming to you.
14570#Freke wields a different type of magic from my witchcraft.
14571#Freke's magic stems from an understanding of \nthe essence of the Demon soul,
14572#while my witchcraft merely channels its energy.
14573#If the Demon is cursed, so shall be the witchcraft.
14574#Freke's power comes from human potential, \nwhile mine is a dark, dependent art.
14580#Thank you. I hope that my witchcraft may be of some help.
14590#Thank you. Speak to me again whenever you are in need.
14600#Oh...
14610#Where are you going?
14620#Wh-Why!?
-1#I thought you were different from the rest!
14630#Oh...
14640#Where are you going?
14650#Wh-Why!?
14651#I thought you were different from the rest!
15000# hee hee hee hee...
15001#I have you now, wretched traitor to the King!
15002#I, Miralda, shall show you no mercy!
15010#Are you dead already? Oh, you deserve it.
15011# baboon, hee hee hee...
15020#Foolish traitor to the King!
15021# Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee...
15030# hee hee hee hee
16000#Oh, are you human...
16001#My body hurts, it hurts, it smells so bad...
16002#Please take it easy now...
16003#Please...
16010#thank you
16011#I'm sorry, Dad...
17000#Phew! You saved me.
17001#Heavens, I can't believe I fell for that trap.
17002#I suppose I owe you now.
17003#I'm graverobber Blige.
17004#As thanks I can provide you with useful goods.
17005#Who couldn't do with a little help down in these parts?
17010#Satisfied? I'll have more for you next time.
17011#May we have a long and fruitful relationship!
17020#Nothing suits your fancy? Well, don't be too frugal.
17021#A bit of indulgence goes a long way.
17030#Hello, there. We meet again.
17031#You look terrible. Cheer up, life is an adventure! \nHahahah.
17040#Ah, hello. I'm here to please. What can I get you?
17050#All done? Good day.
17051#Be sure not to get yourself killed!
17060#This shrine was used in a ghastly ritual \nby an ancient tribe.
17061#They have long perished, and now Demons have\nput the souls to work.
17062#At least here you're killing things that are already dead,\nlike skeletons and shadow lurkers.
17063#That's what I like about this place.
17064#Better than killing those poor soul-starved humans, right?
17070#There's somebody I ought to warn you about. \nA fellow who lacks common decency.
17071#They call him Patches the Hyena, \nand he's the one that laid that trap for me.
17072#He's the kind of person who'd stab his mother in the back.
17073#If you happen to spot him, you'll be doing us all a\nfavour by putting him out of his misery.
17080#Have you been to the altar where sorcerers summon shadows?
17081#Well, I think someone may be trapped in the lower cavity. \nI heard them praying for dear life.
17082#Pity the poor fool. \nHe probably fell for one of Patches' old tricks.
17090#This is where the ancient barbarians offered \ntheir honoured heroes to the winds.
17091#To seek winds in life, and meet winds in death. \nThat was the warrior's code.
17092#And all that's left here now is a fine pile of dust.
17093#I've never been so wrong about a dig. \nI've disgraced the Blige line of graverobbers!
17100#What the hell's wrong with you?
17101#Have you been possessed by a soul?
17110#Hmm... Well, suit yourself.
17111#But a bit of indulgence goes a long way.
17120#Hey, wait! I'm not finished yet!
17130#I'll forgive you this time, but don't do it again.
17140#I have nothing to sell to the likes of you.
18000#Hm? I haven't seen you around these parts.
18001#Bah, what does it matter? You need a blacksmith,\nshow me some coin. If not, head straight for the door.
18010#Bah. What be your need?
18011#If it be a blacksmith, then show me some coin. \nIf not, head straight for the door.
18020#All done? Then be gone. I work alone.
18030#Bah. Don't waste my time.
18034#Hey, come back this instant!
18036#I have no business with your kind.
18037#I am busy. Be gone with you.
18040#I am busy. I'm not here to chit-chat.
18041#Forging a weapon strengthens it, and alters its character.
18042#Ores are transmogrified sprites. \nTheir presence blesses the weapon.
18050#How many times must I tell you? \nI am busy. I've no time for chit-chat.
18051#Ores are picky, and fickle.
18052#No matter how gently you treat them, a different type\nwill not give its blessing to the same weapon.
18053#Of course, they are unpredictable in nature, \nand some are less fickle than others.
18060#I told you that I am busy.
18061#Each ore has a grade.
18062#Mighty weapons can only be blessed by ores of high grade.
18063#The highest grade of all is a pure ore that shines in\nutter brilliance. A spirit force that delights the eyes...\nKeh heh heh heh.
18070#Demon Souls?
18071#The Demons are powerful spirits; \nsome can even bless weapons.
18072#But doing so requires a powerful flame...
18073#For the soul of a Demon is an inferno of wrath.
18080#Yes, that's the one, a red-hot Demon Soul.
18081#Now you can bless your weapon with another Demon Soul.
18090#Hm, a wise choice. You have done well to put your\ntrust in the great blacksmith Ed.
18091#Bring me a Demon soul, \nand I shall use it to bless your weapon.
18100#Now, surely you jest!
18101#...Why talk all that nonsense, if you've no\nsuch intention...?
18102#...The poor lad doesn't know a good blacksmith when \nhe sees one and hardly deserves a Demon soul...
18110#What the hell are you doing?
18111#I'm just a blacksmith, you fool!!
19000#You there!
19001#Won't you buy something? My poor child is hungry.
19010#Finished already?
19011#My little one is a growing boy. Please be generous.
19020#Curses! I wasted my breath on you!
19021#Did that witch send you to torment me!?
19030#Hey, I know you!
19031#Won't you buy something? \nMy poor child is sick. He needs your help!
19040#Finished already?
19041#You wretched penny-pincher. \"Just let the children of\nthe poor die,\" is that it?
19050#Please buy another. For the poor child, the poor child!
19060#Finished already?
19061#I only want my dear boy to be happy.
19070#Ever since that Demon witch came here,\neverything has turned foul.
19071#This was a much better place before she came. \nI was the apple of every man's eye.
19072#You're here to rid us of her, aren't you? \nWell, don't show her any mercy!
19080#You don't deserve to die, so let me give you some advice.
19081#This place is buzzing with pests fattened \non a diet of souls.
19082#In order to protect yourself, \nyou must keep a Lotus with you.
19083#The price of survival can never be too high, can it?
19090#This place? It's a proper mound of rubbish.
19091#All the rot of the world, living or not, ends up here.
19092#I thank the stars that I still have my boy...
19100#How many years has it been?
19101#That witch Astraea came to this valley \nwith that squid-headed knight.
19102#Those ridiculous white robes of hers...\nI swear I caught her glaring at my son in disgust!
19103#Yes, yes, it's true! She is as nasty as they come.
19104#And she's a Demon to boot! Doesn't surprise me.
19110#You beast! What're you doing to me!?
19111#Even beggars can fight back, you scurvy rat!
19120#Don't you just walk away!
19130#For the love of god...
19131#I've had enough humiliation for one lifetime.
20000#Oh, human, are you?
20001#I am Freke. I have been trapped here for ages.
20002#Perhaps you could help me get out of here?
20003#I am a sage, and I can lend you my power in return.
20004#Oh, take heed of those octopus-headed guards.
20010#Magnificent. I never expected to get out of there alive.
20011#My name is Freke. I am known as a sage.
20012#I thought my magic would give me an edge \nagainst these Demons, but how wrong I was...
20013#I have been enfeebled by my long imprisonment.
20014#But I can still move my legs, \nand I can make it back to the Nexus.
20015#I thank the stars that I escaped when I did.\nI owe you my life.
20020#I have been enfeebled by my long imprisonment.
20021#But I can still move my legs, \nand I can make it back to the Nexus.
20500#Hmm...
20501#I have a proposal for you.
20502#Could you bring your Demon Souls to me?
20503#As I determine more about the essence of the soul, \nI can teach you new magic.
20504#A Demon's soul is no mere amalgamation of lesser souls.
20505#You have your wits about you; surely you understand me?
20508#If you wish to be a magician, come to me.
20510#Bravo! Thank you for offering your Demon souls!
20511#I cannot express my gratitude.
20512#To have my wish granted at so late an age...!
20513#Thank you. You are a fine magician.
20514#As promised, let me teach you new magic.
20520#Bravo! You have brought more Demon souls to me!
20521#Thank you. You are a fine magician.
20522#Let me pass on further arts of the wand.
20523#...I am one step closer to the essence of the Demon soul...
20524#...Our human potential is great...
20526#Bring me more Demon souls when you can!
20527#I patiently await you, my fine magician friend!
20530#I am fully prepared. Please fetch more Demon Souls.
20531#I can still be patient, my fine magician friend!
20540#I know of three human leaders who became Demons.
20541#King Allant of Boletaria, \nAstraea of the Valley of Defilement, \nand the golden elder of Latria.
20542#They have proven that humans can evolve to a higher state.
20543#We were wrong to assume that only Demons could\ndo demon work.
20550#I was defeated and captured by the golden elder\nbeyond that dungeon.
20551#Beware of him, for he manipulates souls.
20552#He has power over dark souls, those susceptible to\nmadness and paranoia.
20560#Do you have a connection to the disciples?
20561#Do not pay attention to them if they speak poorly of\nme and my magic.
20562#Prayer is for the foolish, quaint, and soon-to-be dead.
20563#And heaven forbid the day you find out \nwhat their so-called God really is...
20570#That witch Yuria is quite a compelling woman.
20571#She uses a different type of magic than I. \nHers is powered by emotion; a lesser type of miracle.
20572#I wonder if it is related to her gender?
20573#I still have much to learn...
20580#As you know, magic is one of the soul arts.
20581#The scourge of Boletaria has activated all souls, \nand energized all magic.
20582#Perhaps, then, we should work to preserve this state\nof heightened reality?
20583#No, no, heaven forbid.
20584#The Demons steal souls, and with them, our sanity.
20585#Such blasphemy must not be permitted.
20591#Hello.
20592#You assisted me in Latria. For that I thank you.
20593#But at my age, I do not believe that I can be\nof help to you.
20600#I don't care, go ahead
20601#If this leg starts moving, I'll escape to the temple of the wedge
20610#Why, you have defeated all the Demons, have you not?
20611#This ghastly howl...\nThe Monumental has spoken of it before...
20612#There is a question I have long had in my mind.
20613#It is whether we are right to banish the Old One.
20614#And I now have the answer, and it is a resounding \"no.\"
20615#Listen closely. The Old One must not be cut off from us.
20616#If the candle maiden tries to entrap it, kill her.
20617#Then absorb the souls of the Old One for yourself.
20618#The Old One is an unfathomable deposit of energy; \nit contains all the souls collected by the Demons.
20619#You will gain the power of a King, \nand I will gain knowledge from beyond.
20620#And that, my dear friend, is the righteous path. \nYou must not allow trifling matters to dissuade you.
20621#The Demon souls shall be ours!
20622#If truth be told, that woman has been tainted by\nDemons herself. She would thank you in her death,\nfor relieving her... agony.
20630#Where are you going?
20640#What in the devil is wrong with you?
20641#What can you gain by killing me?
20650#Where are you going?
20660#What in the devil is wrong with you?
20661#What can you gain by killing me?
21000#You're an ordinary human, aren't you? \nWhere do you call home?
21001#Dear me, I shouldn't pry. Oh, perhaps you'd like\nsomething from my collection?
21002#I've had better days. I was once the wife of royalty,\nand I have some nice things to show for it.
21010#Thank you.
21011#Now I can stay here for a little while longer.
21020#Well, that's quite alright.
21021#I wish to stay here, but I need souls to stay sane. \nSurely you must understand this...
21030#Oh, it's you. Are you looking to purchase something today?
21032#My, don't just run off!
21034#You came back... Are you looking for something\nspecial today?
21040#Before, there were many others trapped here.
21041#But they went mad, and ventured above,\nof their own volition.
21042#Redemption? Hah. There exists no such thing.
21050#The Queen banished her depraved old husband from the land.
21051#He returned in strange golden garb with foul Demons in tow.
21052#They pillaged great Latria, land of the learned, \nand locked us in this dungeon.
21053#Since then, they've been feeding off our souls...
21054#Telling us over and over that if we go above, \nwe will be granted redemption.
21060#I know the truth.
21061#The church goddess may die, but never for long.
21062#And we are trapped below forever.
21070#Are you out for blood?
21071#For heaven's sake! Why on earth!?
22000#Oh! The Demons haven't got to you, have they? I'm in luck.
22001#You see that pit? It's filled with treasure, \nbut, er, I can't get to it myself.
22002#Go on, have a look! It's more riches than \nI've ever dreamed of!
22003#That's it, that pit just there. Go on, get a little closer.
22005#What's keeping you?
22006#Have a look at that treasure down in the pit.
22007#Then we'll work out a way to fish it out. Heh heh heh.
22010#Heh heh, don't hold it against me, eh?
22011#Take your time starving to death; \nthen I'll sell every last trinket off your corpse!
22012#Keh heh heh heh!
22020#Y-You...
22021#Hey look, I'm really sorry, I didn't mean what I said.
22022#I mean, a man's got to make a living, right? \nHere, look, I can make up for it.
22023#There aren't many humans like us. We need to stick together!
22024#I know! Here, take this, as a token of my friendship. \nYou've seen one of these before, surely?
22026#Heh heh heh.
22027#C'mon, let's be friends, what do you say?
22028#No need to drag each other down.
22030#You slimy little wretch!
22031#What did I ever do to you?!
22040#Oh, hello again.
22041#Hey, don't turn a cold shoulder. \nI didn't mean to do you wrong, really!
22042#C'mon now, we've got better things to fret about!
22043#That pit there is filled with treasure, \nbut, er, I can't get to it myself.
22044#Go on, have a look! \nIt's more riches than I've ever dreamed of!
22100#Oh, hello again.
22101#Hey, don't turn a cold shoulder. \nI didn't mean to do you wrong, really!
22102#Oh, I have an idea!
22103#That treasure over there should be mine, \nbut I'll let YOU have it!
22104#I promise, no tricks! I won't move a muscle\nuntil the treasure's safely in your hands.
22105#You can trust me... can't you? I'm just trying to do\nright and make amends here, hmm?
22107#What's the matter? You're too good for treasure?
22110#Oh, oh!! Who'd have thought it? Bearbugs!
22111#My apologies. It's just not your day.
22112#As promised, the treasure is all yours. \nIf you survive, that is!
22113#Good luck to you!
22120#You... How did you do that?
22121#I really didn't attempt to fool you. It was just bad luck.
22122#And besides, you're safe and sound, right? \nWorry not, worry not.
22123#Here it is, your little treasure, safe and sound.
22124#Go on, take it, take it! Heh heh heh heh.
22130#Heh heh heh.
22131#You're simply unlucky. Worry not.
22132#Stay by me, and my luck'll rub off on you soon enough!
22140#Hey, where are you off to?
22145#What's the matter? I'm going out on a limb here;\ngive me a chance to prove my good faith.
22147#What's the matter? You're too good for treasure?
22150#Oh, you're not mad like the rest, are you?
22151#Well, what jolly travelling companions are we! \nPleased to meet you; call me Patches.
22152#Oh, see that treasure over there? Go on and take it.
22153#My gift to you, just to show that we're friends.
22154#Phew, I'm glad to meet you. \nThese soul-starved imbeciles will drive you mad.
22156#You... How did you do that?
22160#You... How did you do that?
22161#Worry not, the treasure is all yours!
22162#Tough luck with the bearbugs, \nbut you certainly showed them, didn't you?
22163#Here it is, the treasure, safe and sound.
22164#Go on, take it, take it! Heh heh heh heh.
22167#You... How did you do that?
22168#Worry not, the treasure is all yours!
22170#Well, I remember you.
22171#I'm glad I found you. I've found some really nice trinkets.
22172#Well, we've been long acquainted, so I'm willing to part\nwith them at a special price, but only if you buy today!
22175#Nice stuff, eh? Come again, then. I'll be a-waiting!
22177#Well, do as you please, but you may yet regret\nrefusing my offer.
22180#Oh, I've not seen YOU of late.
22181#I have some precious new stuff. \nYou'll find something really useful, surely.
22185#Good stuff, eh? You won't find it anywhere else. \nI aim to please!
22187#Well, do as you please, but don't come a-crying\nwhen it works not.
22189#Well, how was it? Aren't you glad we're such\ngood friends? Heh heh heh heh.
22191#Fine, fine, fine, I cannot make you. \nThough I know you'll come back soon.
22200#I've not seen YOU of late.
22201#Heh heh heh, have I got some stuff for you!
22202#No, no, don't mention it! It's the least I can do\nfor a dear friend! But do pay for them.
22210#Nothing here is stolen, I swear.
22211#I no longer partake in the whole corpse-robbing thing.
22212#Yeah... No, I'm completely free from my vice. \nMy old Mother would be proud indeed!
22213#Aren't you proud of me too?
22220#You see that priest and his disciples over there?
22221#They still don't trust me after that little incident\nbehind the altar.
22222#Shouldn't they believe in forgiving \nand forgetting and all that?
22223#Well, I have news for them. Praying has not put food\nin my mouth, nor anyone else's.
22230#I have bad news.
22231#There's a rumour that the silent chief Yurt has\ninfiltrated Boletaria.
22232#Yurt's a mercenary; he'd kill his own kin for\nthe right price.
22233#Now, I'm not a saint, but compared to Yurt I'm as\nsaintly as they come.
22234#So I implore you to stay away from Yurt, \nthe assassin in black.
22240#Did you ever visit the Valley of Defilement?
22241#The bog there is filled with the corpses of honourable\nknights too foolish to stay out of harm's way.
22242#You may have heard of some of them. \nVito the Moonlight Knight, Risaia of Istarel, \nand many, many more.
22243#I reckon they left behind some fine armour and weapons. \nWhy not have a visit... see what you can find?
22250#You slimy little wretch!
22251#What did I ever do to you?!
22260#You slimy little wretch!
22261#What did I ever do to you?!
22270#Hey, where are you off to?
22280#Hey, where are you off to?
24000#Thank you.
24001#I will remember this.
24002#I am certain we will meet again.
24010#Mmm, hello brave one.
24011#I was looking for you just now.
24012#I am Yurt, the Silent Chief. I am an assassin.
24013#My work in Boletaria is almost complete. \nI have murdered every surviving human.
24014#...Except for one.
24020#Meddling souls never last for long...
24030#…Are you against demons?
24031# If so, get me out of here
24032#My thoughts are with you... above all, to fight demons
24040#Are you here to fight the Demons?
24041#If so, then help me escape this place.
24042#I am on your side. I have come to face the Demons.
24050#Come back here!
24051#You will one day regret this! \nI do not forget those who do me wrong!
24060#Ah... The brave one.
24061#I am indebted to you for your help in Latria.
24062#Without it, I would not have made it back to the Nexus.
24063#Now I can go on with my work...
24064#And for that, I must thank you.
24070#What is it?
24071#I have no business with you. Not yet.
24072#Do not be concerned.
24073#Life is hardly as precious as one might think.
24080#Well, what have we here?
24081#Do you wish to die so soon?
24090#Why, you...!
24091#Mephistopheles was right about you!
24100#Well, what have we here?
24101#Do you wish to die so soon?
24110#Why, you...!
25000#Caw, you, scary!
25001#Give sparkly, me! Give twinkly, me!
25002#Me, caw, you, trade, trade!
25003#Give me. Sparkly-twinkly.
25010#Caw, caw, you, scary, caw.
25011#Sparkly, happy, happy! Caw.
25012#More trade? More trade?
25013#Give me. Sparkly-twinkly.
25014#Please, please. Give, caw, give!
25020#You, scary, caw.
25021#No sparkly! Caw. That not twinkly!
25022#Want sparkly, me. Caw. Want...want twinkly, me. Caw.
25023#Me, you, trade. Give. Caw.
25030#Caw, caw, you, scary.
25031#Me have that.
25032#Give sparkly, me! Caw. Give twinkly, me!
25033#Caw, caw, caw. Me, you, trade, trade.
25034#Give me. Caw. Sparkly-twinkly. Caw, caw.
25035#Please, please, Give, give! Caw, caw, caw.
25040#Sparkly, happy, happy! Caw.
25050#No sparkly! Caw. That not twinkly!
25060#Me have that.
25061#Give sparkly, me! Caw. Give twinkly, me!
25070#Caw, caw, you, scary, caw.
25071#Sparkly, happy, happy! Caw.
26000#Oh, it's you.
26001#Did you cleanse the world of another dark soul today?
26002#God has chosen you, and for that we are thankful.
26003#Umbasa.
26499#Oh, hello there.
26500#Thanks to you, I was able to seek refuge in this Nexus.
26501#Now I stay here and pray, along with my disciples, \nfor the heroes facing the Demons.
26502#If you wish for benevolent protection in your fight\nagainst the demons, then bring me Demon Souls.
26503#I will cleanse them, and perform a miracle with their power.
26510#I see
26511#but don't forget. Soul is the evil power of demons.
26520#Oh, is that you again?
26521#Do you have further gifts to offer?
26530#God bless this brave warrior.
26531#Umbasa.
26533#Yes, I see.
26534#I certainly cannot force you to do anything.
26535#But you must remember this. \nA Demon's Soul is a source of evil power.
26540#As you know, souls are a source of evil power \nemanating from the Demons.
26541#King Allant was overcome by a lust for such power, \nand has placed Boletaria in her present predicament.
26542#Old Freke and the candle maiden are no exception...
26550#If you truly are a disciple, then you must have\na talisman in God's image.
26551#Heavenly miracles occur in Boletaria through the talismans.
26552#God has granted this accursed land with a special power.
26553#It is God's way of telling us \nwe must stand up to the Demons.
26559#Oh, it's you.
26560#Thanks to you, I managed to seek refuge in this Nexus.
26561#Now I stay here and pray, along with my disciples, \nfor the heroes facing the Demons.
26562#May the heavens smile benevolently upon you.
26563#Umbasa.
26570#Heavens, did you fall for that little devil's trap?
26571#Well, I did the same. He fooled me, and now I am stuck here.
26572#The reverberations seem to suggest \nthat we are connected to the outside.
26573#But dark, fearsome souls stand between us and freedom.
26574#But have no fear, God will cleanse us of evil.
26575#Pray with me.
26576#Umbasa.
26580#Where are you going?
26590#What are you doing?
26591#Wha--! Have the souls driven you mad!?
26600#Stop it.
26601#You will anger the heavens.
26610#After the dark arts spread across the land, \nholy miracles were witnessed once again.
26611#The will of God is clear.
26612#We must defeat the Demons, annul the curse of Boletaria,
26613#and purge the evil magicians who \nmanipulate those accursed souls.
26620#Ah, Astraea of the Valley of Defilement?
26621#I am not sure, but Saint Astraea of the West was\naccompanied by the knight Garl Vinland.
26622#She would never turn to evil with \nthat upstanding knight to guide her.
26623#Surely it is mere slander. \nSadly, the weak are prone to such backstabbing.
26630#Vito the Moonlight Knight, Risaia of Istarel, \nand Selen Vinland.
26631#Many honourable knights have ventured into Boletaria \nin search of the Valley of Defilement.
26632#The vicious rumours about Astraea offend our \nmost basic sense of respect for God's name.
26633#However, none of these great knights has made it back.
26634#Could it be that the wretched valley is so infested with \ngrime that even our Lord's voice does not resonate there?
26635#Or... perhaps it is the fate of those left behind by God...
26650#From where does that howl come!?
26651#That is no Demon.
26652#It sounds more like a poor, hungry child.
26653#Do you have any idea what it might be?
26654#Something about it puts me at great unease.
26655#May God watch over us. Bless us, and all of Boletaria.
26656#Umbasa.
26660#Where are you going?
26670#What are you doing?
26671#Wha--! Have the souls driven you mad!?
26680#Stop it.
26681#You will anger the heavens.
27000#You will not turn back, will you?
27001#I shall let no harm come to dearest Astraea.
27002#May you rot in the deepest depths of this swamp.
27010#Dearest Astraea... I have failed you.
27020#How dare you persist in intruding upon our haven?
27021#You abandoned us long ago; what right do you have?
27022#We live humble lives. Leave us be!
27030#Plunge to your death...
27031#And let the acid melt the flesh from your bones.
27040#Ye covetous ones, let it be known.
27041#We shall defend our hearth and home to the death.
28000#How did you defeat my precious Demon?
28001#No human has an appetite for souls such as you.
28002#The rest is up to the Old One. \nIf it is to be, then you shall be beckoned.
28500#You have been chosen by the Old One.
28501#Shalt thou seek everlasting demon Souls? \nOr obey that naive Monumental?
28502#Whatever your choice, you are our first visitor. \nMay you be welcome here.
28510#Surely you have seen for yourself...
28511#The pain and suffering that fills this world!
28512#But fight poison with poison. \nGod is merciful, and so, created the Old One.
28513#The Old One will feed upon our souls, \nand put an end to our tragic realm of existence!
28520#You fool...
28521#Don't you understand?
28522#No one wishes to go on...
28530#I have had enough of this rotten world.
29000#Leave us, slayer of Demons.
29001#This is a sanctuary for the lost and wretched.
29002#There is nothing here for you to pillage or plunder.
29003#Please, leave quietly.
29010#Go forth, Garl Vinland.
29011#May you be unharmed.
29020#Cruel Lord...
29021#What more can you possibly take from us?
29030#Stop...
29031#Please stop...
29040#This is our home.
29041#We have done no harm to you.
29050#Dear God, have mercy.
29051#Is not your abandonment of us punishment enough?
29052#How long must we weather this cruel fate?
29060#Please, leave quietly...
29061#Lest you face the wrath of my loyal follower.
29070#You...
29071#You killed him, didn't you?
29072#Very well. I can no longer resist you.
29073#Do as you like. Take your precious Demon soul.
29080#Dear Lord...
29081#You are too cruel.
29082#You have abandoned us, is that not punishment enough?
30000#Hey!
30001#You nearly frightened me to death! \nCreeping up on me like that...
30002#My name is Scirvir. I seek treasures of the unknown.
30003#I'm impressed you've come this far.
30004#Where you guided by a sixth sense? Or a brash\nimprudence? Either way, you've more skill than I.
30010#Let us put that skill to work?
30011#There is a temple beyond here, below the ground.
30012#It is a work of art, moulded by the ancient burrowers \nto appease the bones of dragons.
30013#As a precaution, a broadsword which can crush bone \nand slay dragon is stored in the temple.
30014#Truth told, it is the laughingstock of many a swordsmith. \nThey say it's as blunt as a bludgeon.
30015#A dull blade meant to slay a dragon... Curious, is it not?
30016#I would search for it myself, but I'm afraid I'd fare\npoorly against the Demons.
30017#If you happen to come upon the sword, \nplease let me have a look at it.
30020#Hey!
30021#Oh, you...
30030#Hmm, no luck finding it, eh? \nPerhaps it's not there after all.
30031#Or, it could have been melted in the lava. 'Tis a pity.
30038#Hey! That's...!
30039#You found it!
30040#Let me have a look!
30050#Wonderful. The arts of swordsmanship applied in a \nperfectly useless manner!
30051#Hm...
30052#Ah...
30053#Mm...
30054#Oh, do not mind me. Thank you. It was a pleasure.
30055#Please take this as a small show of thanks.
30056#Take care of that sword, will you? She's a beauty.
30060#This place is magnificent, eh?
30061#The bones of dragons exuding ore... A dream come true!
30070#Demons? Sorry, friend, I have no interest.
30071#I love Boletaria for what she is: a place of odd wonders.
30072#Strange faces... wielding strange trinkets...\nhiding in strange places.
30073#I'm beginning to think Boletaria \nis better off now than it used to be.
30074#Hah hah, don't tell anyone I said that!
30075#I could get myself into bother if I'm not careful.
30080#Have you gone mad!?
30081#You've nothing to gain by assaulting me!
30090#Stop it! I'll come back to haunt you!
31004#What is it?
31005#Dost thou seek soul power?
31010#…Do you also seek the power of souls?
31011#…Okay. Please sit in front of me and touch my heart
31012#Please...
31014#Thou seeketh soul power, dost thou not?
31015#Then touch the Demon inside me.
31020#So be it.
31021#After all, thou requireth strength.
31022#Go forth; touch the Demon inside me.
31023#Let these ownerless souls become thine own.
31025#I understand.
31026#Pray forgive me.
31027#Perhaps my opinion of you was wrong. I am sorry.
31030#The truth of all living things that will no longer return to the Lord
31031# O understanding of relationships and the power of the soul that mediates them
31032#Give this person a possibility, and thus make it a side of the world
31033#Thus, let the world draw near
31040#Art thou done?
31041#May thine strength help the world be mended.
31050#The Monumental awaits thee, above.
31051#The Monumental will explain the Nexus to thee.
31060#Hark, I hear a voice of yore.
31061#The Old One is calling for thee.
31062#Let us proceed below to its lair.
31065#Let us proceed below to its lair.
31070#Old One, I have brought thee what thou wisheth.
31071#Thine new Demon.
31072#Come, now, be good...
31080#Thine work is done.
31081#Slayer of Demons, go back above.
31082#The Nexus shall imprison thee no longer.
31083#I shall lull the Old One back to slumber.
31084#Thanks to you, I was able to look like a lovely beast
31090#Brave soul, who fears not death.
31091#Prithee lull the Old One back to its ancient slumber.
31100#I shall await thine return, slayer of Demons.
31101#I am here for thee and thee only.
31110#My thanks.
31111#At last... at last... my duty is fulfilled...
31120#Ancient Old One! My dearest!
31121#I have brought a new Demon to thee.
31122#This is what thou wanted, is it not?
31123#Yes, yes, good boy.
31124#Now be still.
31125#Now, now, dearest Old One...
31130#Old One, all the Demons are destroyed.
31131#But do not despair; they are of use to thee no longer.
31132#Together, we shall slumber soundly. \nThis is the way things must be.
31133#I thank thee, slayer of Demons.
31134#My thanks to thee; we sleep at last.
31135#Thou may'st depart. Be gone to your world.
31140#The Old One and I shall slumber interminably. \nThat is the way it must be.
31141#Thou may'st go. Be gone to thine world.
31150#As for me...
31151#I am only here to tend to the flames.
31152#I keep the candles lit and serve \nthe brave Demon slayers who are trapped here.
31160#I have always been here in this Nexus.
31161#I was here when the Old One awakened, \nand I will be here when It rests once again.
31170#Ah... (Subdued scream)
31172#Ugh... (Subdued scream)
31174#Kyaah
31176#Wait... Where are you...?
31180#I'm sorry.
31181#I cannot die.
31182#Not while the Nexus binds me...
31190#I'm sorry.
31191#I cannot die.
31192#Not while the Nexus binds me...
32500#We have long awaited you, slayer of Demons.
32501#I am one of the Monumentals. \nWe preserve the fabric of reality.
32502#There is something thou needst to know.
32503#Once, we too, a scourge of Demons faced.
-1#In the distant past,
-1#under a benevolent rule the world was united, \nowing to the Soul arts.
-1#Until a lust for power caused the awakening of the Old One.
-1#Across the land seeped a colourless Deep Fog,
-1#and the world faced extinction at the hands of the Demons.
-1#Thanks be, we were able to lull the Old One\nback to Its slumber,
-1#yet only after the loss of innumerable souls,
-1#and half the world, lost... erased by the fog.
-1#In order to mend the fabric of what land still remained,
-1#we entrusted six elders with six precious Archstones.
-1#  One to the king of a small yet diligent land,
-1#  one to the king of the burrowers underground,
-1#  one to the wise queen of the great ivory tower,
-1#  one to the chieftain of lost and ill-fortuned souls,
-1#  one to the shaman of the tempest-worshipping shadowmen,
-1#  And the last to the great giants of the Northern Lands.
-1#The Archstones were placed at nodes across the earth.
-1#we contained the Old One inside this Nexus, \nand banned the soul arts.
-1#Finally, we became Monumentals; \nhalf-living sentinels of the fabric of reality.
-1#Alas, the other Monumentals have perished, \nand only I remain.
32510#Yes, we are fortunate indeed to have you.
32511#Now, go forth, and destroy every last Demon.
32512#The Old One, without Demons to feed it souls, \nwill a new servant seek, and lure you to its bosom.
32514#Take this. It will be of help to you on your quest.
32520#Yes, I see. That is unfortunate.
32521#You should know that you will be \nimprisoned in the Nexus forever.
32522#Just like the poor candle maiden.
32523#
32530#Now it is your turn.
32531#You must lull the Old One back to Its slumber, \nand seal It away for all eternity.
32532#If not, the Deep Fog will absorb all that we know.
32533#Have you the strength to accept this mission?
32540#A soul is the essence with which living things \ncomprehend the world around them.
32541#When one loses the Soul, one loses the mind; \na land barren of Souls is absorbed by fog\nand banished to the infinite darkness.
32542#The Old One is a bottomless pit of Nothingness, \nwith an insatiable appetite for the souls \ncollected by its faithful Demons.
32543#The Old One's very nature cannot be fathomed by the living.
32550#We neutralised the Old One, and banned the soul arts. \nThen we spread the Archstones, and in order to mend\nreality, Monumentals we became.
32551#However, man's memory of history is o'er short, \nand before long he repeated his mistakes.
32552#The Monumentals perished, \nand the Archstones were long forgotten.
32553#And the short-sighted King Allant \nonce again aroused the Old One.
32560#The soul arts shall be lost once \nthe Old One is lulled back to slumber.
32561#A soul is the essence of thought which \nis latent in all living things.
32562#You must never forget...
32563#The power that you now enjoy contradicts the essence\nof the soul, for it stems from Demon magic.
32570#You have destroyed all of the Demons.
32571#You soon shall hear the call of the Old One.
32572#Then, the candle maiden shall guide you below the Nexus, \nwhere the Old One awaits.
32573#She will lull the Old One back to slumber.
32574#That is, after all, her purpose.
32580#Hahaha...
32581#Cease, you are wasting your lifeforce.
32582#I am a Monumental. You cannot harm me.
32590#Arrgghaaaaaa!
32591#But... I am a Monumental...!
32600#Have you received assistance from the candle maiden?
32601#She is a prisoner of this Nexus. \nIt is her duty to lull the Old One back to slumber. \nThat is why she helps those who hunt Demons.
32602#And that is why she has become a Demon herself.
32610#Have you visited the pantheon at the uppermost floor?
32611#The pantheon honours those like yourself \nwho sought the Demon souls.
32612#Perhaps one day your soul, too, \nwill be honoured in that same fashion.
32613#That is the most we can do to give you thanks.
32614#To give thanks to the brave and honourable warriors, \nwho must fight to reverse our sins...
32620#hahahahaha
32622#hahahahahaha
32630#You must destroy all the Demons if you wish to be freed \nfrom the curse of the Nexus.
32631#The Old One, without the Demons to feed its souls, \nwill seek a new servant, and lure you to its bosom.
32632#You must lull the Old One back to slumber, \nfor your own sake as well as for ours.
32640#You must despise me.
32641#But remember, we Monumentals, too, \nare trapped within this Nexus.
32642#For we prevent your world from breaking apart at the seams.
32650#Please forgive me, but I wish to concentrate.
32651#'Tis no easy task, being a Monumental.
32653#......
32660#Brave soul, who fears not death.
32661#I shall guide you…
32662#So that you may lull the Old One back to slumber.
33500#Well, you slipped through the fissure too, did you?
33501#You came for Demon souls? Or to save this land,\nand be remembered as a hero?
33502#Bah, it's all the same. \nYou're just another prisoner of the Nexus.
33503#We're welcome here, as long as we keep slashing up Demons.
33504#Hahahahah...
33506#Hunting for Demons? Try one of the archstones.
33507#Now, go. That is why you came, is it not...?\nTo this accursed Boletaria.
33510#Still alive? I am impressed.
33511#This is something that might interest you.
33512#The black-robed maiden of the Nexus looks after the flames. \nShe's a morose type, with eyes occluded by wax.
33513#She can control souls like no other.
33514#Bring her the souls of men and Demons, and she will\nembolden your flesh and blood with their power.
33515#But beware; do not devolve into a foul beast...
33520#Ah, hello again.
33521#I wonder how many others are in this Nexus?
33522#They are no different than I.
33523#They traversed the foggy fissure with determination, \nbut realised their powerlessness, and became\nprisoners of the Nexus.
33530#What, you again?
33531#The disciples and the magicians \nin the Nexus despise one another.
33532#Did you notice they never sit in sight of each other?
33533#The fools. What good comes of childish rivalries? \nWe are all prisoners here.
33540#What's happened, have you lost your nerve?
33541#No matter. Have a seat; we can sit here forever!
33542#At least we will be safe!
33543#Hahahahah...
33550#Have you met the last surviving Monumental?
33551#Those fools revived the Old One on a whim,
33552#and now they've trapped us here in the Nexus \nin a desperate attempt to undo their mistake.
33553#It's all a travesty, if you ask me.
33560#The flame-tending maiden has not come down \nfrom the upper level.
33561#Go ahead, seek her; you monsters deserve each other.
33562#I could not care any less.
33570#You, have you seen my corporeal flesh? \nHas my body gone rotten?
33580#...I'm sorry, please leave me alone.
33590#...Argh... who are you? I don't remember anything...
33600#What are you doing?
33601#Even I will not just sit back and take it!
33610#Hmph. Not enjoying the conversation?
33611#Monster! Do you think that you are somehow special!?
33620#Hm? What is it?
33621#I'm not going anywhere. Question me as you please.
33630#Hahahah, you've gone and died, have you?
33631#If you die here in Boletaria, \nyour soul is returned to the Nexus.
33632#Well, what'll you do next? Going to just give up?
33633#That's what I did.
33634#I think I just lost my nerve for this kind of thing...
33650#Well, you found yourself a Demon soul, did you?
33651#I'm impressed, yes, indeed I am.
33652#Stay the path, and you will soon be a monster yourself!
33653#Hahahahahah!
33654#Can't you see you've fallen for their trap?
35000#Why, you are one of the sane ones, are you not?
35001#I am Selen of the West.
35002#I seek my brother Garl Vinland, the knight who\naccompanied Saint Astraea on her travels.
35003#I believe they settled here.
35004#If you happen to see my younger brother, please tell me.
35005#I must share with him the last words of our father.
35010#This crest!
35011#That is a Vinland heirloom meant for my younger brother.
35012#So, my brother and Astraea have both strayed \nfrom the path of God...
35013#The poor souls. Perhaps their hearts were too pure.
35014#Umbasa.
35020#Thank you, kind warrior.
35021#As Garl's sister, I express my deepest thanks for your\nhonouring of his name.
35022#Please accept this. It was intended for my brother, \nbut now it should belong to you.
35023#May the angels gaze favourably upon you.
35024#Umbasa.
35030#Thank you, kind warrior.
35031#As Garl's sister, I express my deepest appreciation \nfor your honouring of his name.
35035#Please accept this as thanks. \nPerhaps you will have use for it on your travels.
35040#Could you give me a memento of my brother?
35041#Of course, thank you
35050#Yes, I see.
35051#But you must realize that an ordinary crest \nwill bestow upon you no power?
35052#I only wished to remember my poor younger brother by it.
35053#Perhaps you can reconsider?
35060#Yes, I see.
35061#I can no further presume upon you. \nPerhaps this is punishment for Garl's wrongdoing.
35062#I will search for a way back home.
35063#May you be unharmed in battle,
35064#and safe along the roads of your travels.
35070#O travelling warrior...
35071#I hesitate to ask, but can you part with that crest?
35072#Garl has strayed from the path of righteousness, \nbut I wish to have the heirloom, in honour of\nour Vinland blood.
35073#I shall reward you in kind.
35080#What in heaven's name!?
35081#I am no foe of yours!
35090#I find something odd about this place.
35091#It brims with grime, but at once feels strangely pure.
35100#I heard an unflattering rumour about Saint Astraea.
35101#Have you met that herb-peddling woman? \nShe claims that Saint Astraea is herself a demon.
35102#That woman has no reason to lie. \nSurely she must be mistaken.
36000#Well! You are a sane one, aren't you?
36001#My name is Rydell. Please, liberate me from this cell.
36002#I have precious little time. \nI must retrieve an article from my corpse.
-1#But I can't seem to find the key to the prison...
-1#Do you have a key that looks like it?
36010#Yes, don't you have one? It's not so convenient
36020#Yes, I can't find it. No wonder...
36030#No, it's not that kind of key...
36040#The key...I haven't seen it before...maybe I'm looking for it...
36041#Could you give me that key? let me thank you
36050#Why! Thank you! Thank you, kind soul.
36051#Please take this fine piece of work. \nBesides, I have no use for it now.
36052#Ahh, and thus begins my final, eternal rest...
36054#Ahh, and thus begins my final, eternal rest...
36060#Yes, sorry
36061#I don't want to kill people anymore
36070#Lord Black of the frontier is also fallen
36071#I lost the battle, and I still have regrets...
36080#Sorry guys...
36090#oooooooooooooooooooo
36092#Anyone, open here!
36094#Hey! Whoa!
36100#As you can see, the only thing that remains\nof me is my soul.
36101#My body is trapped in another cell; \nI fancy it a fine rotten mess by now.
36102#I've no interest in my corporeal flesh, but I left upon\nmy person a keepsake of my late wife.
36103#I will soon fade into the beyond. \nMy only wish is to do so near that token of my beloved.
36110#A retainer to the King once held the key to this cell.
36111#That ebony swine with his gluttonous, swaying belly...
36120#What's gone wrong with you!? In the Lord's name, stop!
36121#I do not wish to harm anyone!
36122#Especially not you, my kind saviour!
37000#Thou who seeketh the King's sword!
37001#I am the Old King. Show me thine strength and\nthe strength of thine souls.
37005#Prepare thyself, brave knight.
37010#Thou dost well to impress one such as me, young knight.
37011#I am Old King Doran, and thou hast proven thine\nstrength to me.
37012#Go forth, and take the King's sword in thine hand.
37020#I am the Old King. Darest thou to challenge me? Very well.
37021#But may thou be determined from the depths of thine heart, \nelse thou shalt fail.
37022#May fate be with thee.
37025#
39500#Yes, I see...
39501#Your hands are too clean.
39502#I have no use for one such as you.
39510#I can see that you have killed in the past.
39511#No one can blame you for that. \nDemon souls are too precious to relinquish.
39512#Perhaps a knight like you would have \nan interest in my offer?
39515#I want you to kill Prince Ariona Allant. \nHe goes by the pseudonym Ostrava.
39517#You will be rewarded amply.
39518#Do we have an agreement?
39519#A reason? Bah, just think of it as an opportunity to\nextinguish a competitor.
39522#Excellent. I'm relying on you.
39530#Hm, I see. My ears are open, if you ever change your mind.
39531#But remember, I will not linger here long.
39540#What's wrong?
39541#I granted you a simple task; get on with it.
39550#Well, well... Very smooth work. Almost... merciless.
39551#Here is your reward. Be thankful for it; normally it\nwould never find its way into your impure hands.
39553#Now, for your next task.
39555#Kill Prince Ariona Allant. He goes by the pseudonym Ostrava.
39557#I will, of course, provide you with a reward of\nsimilar value.
39560#Hm, done already?
39561#Here is your reward. Take it.
39563#Don't look at me with that ravenous countenance of greed. \nThere is more work for you.
39565#Next, kill Prince Ariona Allant, who goes by the\npseudonym Ostrava.
39567#No reason for pause now, is there?
39570#So, you've completed everything, eh?
39571#You're what they might call a miracle worker.
39572#Lastly, I must only kill you, and the secret of the\nsouls shall be eternally safe.
39580#Fool. Did you really think that you were special?
39590#I want you to kill Biorr.
39592#Kill Biorr of the Twin Fangs.
39594#Next, you will kill Biorr of the Twin Fangs.
39600#I want you to kill Sage Freke and his apprentice.
39602#Kill Sage Freke and his apprentice.
39604#Next, you will kill Sage Freke and his apprentice.
39610#I want you to kill the witch Yuria.
39612#Kill the witch Yuria.
39614#Next, you will kill the witch Yuria.
39620#I want you to kill Saint Urbain and his followers.
39622#Kill Saint Urbain and his followers.
39624#Next, you will kill Saint Urbain and his followers.
39630#I want you to kill Stockpile Thomas.
39632#Kill Stockpile Thomas.
39634#Next, you will kill Stockpile Thomas.
39640#I want you to kill Patches the Hyena.
39642#Kill Patches the Hyena.
39644#Next, you will kill Patches the Hyena.
39650#Are you mad?
39660#A fool such as you is a rare thing...
39670#What's wrong?
40000#Well, you seem to have your head about you.
40001#I am Satsuki. I seek a keepsake of my father.
40002#Have you seen the sword inscribed \"Makoto\"?
40003#I will offer you Demon souls if you can help me find it.
40010#The Makoto chooses its owner.
40011#But he who harbours self-delusions should at once be warned.
40012#The Makoto is no sword for the faint of heart.
40020#Ah, you have found the Makoto, have you?
40021#Bless your good fortune. And, well, your good work.
40022#Now, just hand the Makoto over to me.
40030#Yes, yes, this is she.
40031#This lustre... It's finally mine! Keheheheh...
40032#Except... could this sword really be as deadly \nas the rumours claim?
40033#There is only one way to find out!
40040#What on earth is wrong with you?
40041#How dare you waste my precious time!?\nDo you not want Demon souls?
40050#Fine! Have it your way!
40051#A duel will settle this!
40060#How dare you!
40061#You shall pay in blood!
40070#Hmm, expecting the Makoto to warm up to you?
40071#Nonsense! Your very touch soils her impeccable hilt!
40072#May you plunge to the depths of hell \nfor your unsavoury insolence!
40080#The Makoto lives up to its name. \nIts blade shines with an unworldly perfection.
40081#Keheheh, kehehehehehehahaha!
40090#You useless invertebrate. Face your rotten fate...
40100#Hey, you over there!
40101#You seem to have your head about you.
40102#Come here. I have a proposal for you.
40103#Do not be afraid. You have much to gain.
41000#Hahahahahah...
41001#Ye fools know nothing of the world!
41002#The idols shall be revived for eternity!
41003#Rejoice, fools, for it is as you wished!
41004#Hahahahahah...
41010#Wh-What do you want?
41011#I am a humble servant. I do not wish to interfere.
41012#I won't cause you trouble, I won't!
41020#What are you doing!?
41021#I am merely a servant!
41030#Please stop!
41031#Eek! Eeeeek!
42500#Are you here to face the Demons?
42501#If so, please free Sage Freke the Visionary \nfrom the dungeon of Latria.
42502#I will help you however I can. \nI can teach you elementary spells.
42503#Sage Freke is a gleaming hope for humankind, \nbut I have not the power to save him alone.
42510#Are you begging for a magic lesson?
42520#Be careful how you use it.
42521#Normally, it would not be granted to one such as yourself.
42522#I had to make an exception, for the sake of Sage Freke.
42530#I see. Suit yourself.
42531#Just ensure that you rescue Sage Freke \nas quickly as possible.
42534#You saved Sage Freke, did you not?
42535#Then I was right to bend the rules \nand teach you a few tricks.
42536#Nevertheless, I am grateful to you.
42537#Do you see how important selfless acts are \nin this dreary world?
42540#What is it? Are you still begging for magic lessons?
42541#Oh, so be it.
42542#Better than having you bother Sage Freke.
42550#Freke is a great sage who systemised the magic of the\nSoul arts to make it possible for human imitation.
42551#By observing the state of Boletaria and the Demons\nwithin it, he is likely to pave the way for greater things.
42552#All the more reason that I must meet Freke\nas soon as possible...
42560#Me? Without doubt, I made my best effort to save Sage Freke.
42561#But I had not the strength. It is as simple as that.
42562#Besides, if I myself were captured, \nwho would stand here and recruit rescuers?
42564#Sage Freke prefers to work alone.
42565#Do not dare to bother him by gabbing \nabout trifling nonsense.
42566#He is on the verge of discovering something \nthat will rival even the Demon Souls.
42570#What do you want, brute?
42571#I have no use for miscreants like yourself. Away with you!
42580#Wait! Where are you going?
42590#I am not done yet!
42600#Wh-What are you doing!?
42610#Why!? Have you madness about you?
42611#Cease!
42620#Be careful how you use it.
42630#I see. Suit yourself.
43500#I have sinned.
43501#I swore allegiance to Saint Urbain, \nbut was of no use to him.
43502#And now I have run away, and abandoned his Honourableness.
43510#O Lord, punish me.
43511#For I have not the strength to punish myself.
43520#Oh, Honourable One, I hesitate to imagine your\npresent state.
43521#Deep within the darkness, where no light shall ever shine.
43522#Will you continue to pray, even in such misery?
43530#I swear that I will catch that blasted Hyena some day soon.
43531#He fooled me, and kicked the Honourable One down\na trap door behind the altar of a shrine.
43532#I... lost my nerve, and very swiftly fled out of that place.
43540#My! You have rescued the Honourable One!
43541#I express my deepest gratitude. \nYou have relieved me of a great onus.
43542#Oh, thank God!
43543#Umbasa.
43550#Have you heard the rumours about\nAstraea of the Valley of Defilement?
43551#They claim that she and her loyal knight have\nbecome Demons, and lead a clan of\ndegenerate miscreants.
43552#In truth, the rumours are surely unfounded. \nThere are all sorts of wrongdoers down there \nwho would think up such nonsense.
43553#...Yet, if the rumours are true...
43554#Then may she be eternally damned for her \ndebasement of the Lord's name!
43560#With Lord Urbain back, the magicians will have to\nwatch themselves.
43561#Thanks to his holy miracles, you brave battlers of\nDemons will no longer be solely dependent on\ndark magic.
43562#Isn't it wonderful? Surely the Demon slayers have\nawaited such an opportunity!
43570#Do you have any connection to Patches the Hyena?
43571#I trust not. He is a depraved, vile man, and he\ndeserves no allies.
43572#I hope that an upstanding hero such as yourself is \nselective when making associations.
43573#By the way, I highly recommend the companionship\nof the jovial Sage Urbain!
43580#What? Where are you going?
43581#I have yet to finish...
43590#What are you doing!?
43600#P-Please, stop that!
43610#You have turned against God's teachings! \nLet heaven's wrath be set upon you!
44500#Oh, you must be another disciple of God.
44501#I, too, am on a quest to fight the Demons \nin the name of the Lord.
44502#May I share God's power with you? Do not be bashful; \nwe are both cut from the same cloth.
44510#Miracles are the work of God.
44511#May your actions mimic His greatness.
44520#Oh, fellow disciple, you seek the power of God?
44522#Do you seek the power of God?
44524#Now, come back; I am still speaking.
44525#That hardly befits an honourable warrior such as yourself.
44527#What in the Lord's name has taken you over?
44528#We have a common foe! The Demons!
44530#I see. You wish to train yourself in stoicism. Very well.
44531#I pray we meet again.
44540#Do you want the power of God?
44541#I don't mind, but please also ask for teacher Urbain's teachings
44542#For He Hears God's Voice
44550#Are you asking Master Urbain for guidance?
44551#That's good. please do so
44560#A miracle is a heavenly act, but spells are the acts of\nDemons, the work of soul arts.
44561#They have similar effects, and yet, one is clearly evil, \nand the other is clearly good.
44562#Magicians, in the end, are mere servants of the Demons.
44570#Do you know Saint Urbain?
44571#Saint Urbain is a true sage. He can hear the voice of God.
44572#But that despondent disciple over there claims that \nhe has fallen in a trap behind the altar.
44573#I hate to think that such misfortune could \nhave befallen so eminent a man!
44574#We intend to leave shortly for the altar, \nto rescue Saint Urbain.
44575#God has ordered it done, and we are His disciples.
44576#I am afraid we may not meet again for quite some time.
44580#A warrior from afar, are you?
44581#May you enjoy victory in battle.
44582#Umbasa.
45500#Oh, my, how has this happened?
45501#Has God abandoned us for failing to show \nproper respect to King Allant?
45502#Oh, umbasa...
45510#It is said that if you are attacked by a terrifying demon, you will cease to be a human.
45511#Is this at least a salvation?
45520#Is it you? I'm not lost anymore
45521#Take care of Urbain and pray together
45522#For God's sake. Ambassa
45530#Oh, I can hardly believe it.
45531#The fact that I am helping to save the world!
45532#Oh, Saint Urbain...
45533#Umbasa.
45540#Back in the time that I lived below Boletaria castle,
45541#King Allant left on some strange business, \nthen returned with horrible Demons in tow.
45542#Soon, the land was ravaged by Demons \nand soul-starved madmen.
45543#My spine shudders just to think about it.
45544#If I did not have my miracle stone-shard, a keepsake\nof my grandfather, I may not have survived.
45550#Have you heard?
45551#If you are attacked by a Demon, you will lose your humanity.
45552#What a horrible thought... Just what would happen then?
45553#I simply cannot fathom it.
45554#Umbasa.
45560#My grandfather had unusual tastes.
45561#He often visited Stonefang mine, where he collected\nrocks of all shapes and sizes.
45562#Most of them had no value...
45563#But among them he found a miracle stone-shard, \nwhich he gave to me.
45564#Could this, too, be a sign from God?
45570#Thank goodness; the Lord has not forgotten me yet.
45571#For He has reunited me with Saint Urbain.
45572#I shall serve him, and pray with him.
45573#And thus express my faith in God!
45574#Umbasa!
45580#I plan to bequeath all my possessions to Saint Urbain.
45581#My grandfather's articles may contain more miracle\nstone-shards like the one he gave me.
45582#It has no intrinsic powers in and of itself,
45583#but Saint Urbain can hear the voice of God through it.
45590#I shall always be by Saint Urbain's side.
45591#That is the purpose for which \nGod hath put me upon this earth.
45600#Er... where are you hiding yourself...?
45610#Eek!
45620#Ow!
45630#What are you...! You stop that!
45640#You there...
45641#I can sense it. You can hear the voice of God.
45642#And you are battling those terrible Demons.
45643#Our merciful God has sent you here to protect us!
45644#I will share with you everything I have.
45645#May the heavens gaze favourably upon you.
45646#Umbasa.
45650#Oh, my, how has this happened?
47500#This is Boletaria, a warped world \nshaped by the trade in souls.
47501#Do you have your soul still? Then beware: \nsoul-starved men and terrible Demons will hunt \nyou down for it.
47502#You seem to have plenty about you. \nSurely you realize that you are a sacrifice; \nyou are meant to die here.
47503#Are you in need of a way out? \nYou must begin by seeking knowledge.
47504#I am Tell All. And I can tell you... anything.
47510#Very well. But this is a dangerous place to \nnavigate on one's own.
47520#Wise warrior, do you seek further knowledge?
47530#I see. May God have mercy upon the ignorant.
47540#I am Tell All.
47541#My knowledge is vast, and memory deep.
47542#Trust in me, for I will not misguide you.
47550#Come again, eternal prisoner.
47551#If you wish to save yourself.
47560#Come again.
47561#If you survive, I have much more to tell.
47570#What foolishness...
47571#What will violence accomplish here?
47580#Where are you going?
47581#Do you fear the truth?
48500#I'm Stockpile Thomas.
48501#When the Scourge came, I didn't know what hit me. \nWhen I came to, I found myself here, in the Nexus.
48502#My wife and daughter fell victim to the Demons.
48503#But I would be worthless in battle. \nAt the very least, I hope to lend my assistance \nto you brave slayers of Demons.
48504#I would be happy to lighten your load \nand look after any excess baggage.
48510#Rest assured. Your goods are safe and sound with me.
48511#Best of luck to you!
48520#Hello again.
48521#I'm keeping a close watch on your belongings. Rest assured!
48530#You have a heart of gold. Don't let them take it from you.
48540#Thank goodness you are safe!
48541#I was worried sick about you.
48550#We are indebted to you, for you fight on our behalf.
48552#Wait, where are you going?
48554#What was that about? Running off like that.
48560#When the Scourge came, I abandoned my wife and daughter, \nand fled like a madman.
48561#When I came to, I was in the Nexus. \nI haven't dared venture outside these walls since.
48562#I wish I could do more, but I am ignorant of the world\nbeyond these walls.
48570#That candle maiden cared for me \nduring my first days in the Nexus.
48571#She says very little, but has a kind heart. \nShe's just the age my young daughter would have been.
48572#The poor, poor girl... trapped here \nwith her eyes occluded by wax.
48573#If only something could be done to help her...
48580#Th-Th-That hairpin! That belongs to my daughter!
48581#...Then, she didn't make it after all...\nmy dearest little baby... may she rest in peace...
48582#May I ask you a favour?
48583#Would you mind giving up that hairpin? \nI'd like to have it in memory of my daughter.
48590#You're a saint!
48591#Thank you, thank you so much!
48592#Oh, I mustn't forget...
48593#It's not much, but please accept this as thanks.
48594#I'm a bit ashamed to say, but I found it one day,\ndiscarded on the main road.
48595#But it seems to possess a strange power.
48596#Anyway, I feel that you should have it. \nIt will be happier in your hands.
48600#Yes, yes, of course...
48601#You are the one who found it; it should remain yours.
48602#Hahaha, please, forgive me. \nI didn't mean to get emotional.
48603#Hahahaha...
48610#Saints, sages, and all manner of wise men \nwatch over the halls of this Nexus.
48611#This rejuvenating sanctorium is a fine place \nfor the slayers of Demons to rest their weary bones.
48612#I, too, must contribute how I can, \nfor we are indebted to our honourable defenders.
48620#What is the world like outside the Nexus?
48621#With brave souls like you confronting these vile Demons,
48622#perhaps it won't be long before things return to normal.
48623#At least, that is what we are all praying for...
48630#Sometimes I stop and wonder
48631#how I ended up in the Nexus in the first place.
48632#Why didn't I protect my wife and daughter, \neven if it meant being slain by the Demons?
48633#Hahahah, please forgive me. I am over it now.
48640#How do you do it?
48641#I can't imagine what it takes to slay a Demon...
48642#If only I could assist in this fight...
48650#What on earth has come over you!?
48651#In God's name, stop!
49000#Heh heh heh, hello there!
49001#Souls, souls! I trade fine goods for souls!
49010#Heh heh heh! It's a pleasure doin' business with yer.
49020#Yer want to play, well, you've got to pay.
49021#Don't you agree?
49030#Heh heh heh, remember me?
49031#I've got plenty o' wares, so bring me plenty o' souls!
49040#Heh heh heh, hello. Here to make a deal?
49050#Heh heh, hello there. Bless yer souls!
49052#Heh heh...well all right then.
49053#Come back when you actually need something!
49055#Where're yer running off to?
49057#Heh heh heh, stop with yer messing!
49060#Our little town? Well, heh heh... It's a nice wee place.
49061#All those lizard-eyed townsfolk are busy tinkering \nwith stone, and don't bother with old men like meself.
49062#Makes life rather easy for me. \nI can get away with anything! \nHeh heh heh heh.
49063#Thank you, Lord, for this golden opportunity! Heh heh heh.
49070#Have you heard about that sparkling lizard?
49071#He's not easy to catch, but he's got some fine stones.
49072#And I know where his nest is!
49073#Oh, I'm sorry, I can't give it away! Heh heh heh heh!
49080#Heh heh heh, have you heard?
49081#Deep below this mine, there's a dragon shrine filled\nwith dragon bones.
49082#Well, according to little Scirvir, anyway.
49083#I'm not about to go and find out.
49084#Those bearbugs scare the living daylights out of me!
49090#What do you think you're doing!
49091#You can't get around me easy, so watch yourself!
50000#Hm? You new here? Are you here for my services?
50001#The name's Boldwin... Just an ordinary blacksmith.
50002#It's simple. Just bring me all the souls you can.
50003#In trade, I'll give you weapons. \nOr forge ones you already have.
50004#With your souls, I can eke out a living, \nand with my weapons, you can go on living. \nNot a bad deal, eh?
50010#Oh, good day to you.
50011#I can forge weapons for you, for a fair price.
50020#Do come back alive. I need your business.
50030#No interest, eh?
50031#I can tell you're not going to last long here...
50033#What's the hurry? Where're you off to?
50034#Have you any manners?
50036#I'll excuse the rudeness, but only this once.
50037#You're lucky that it's me and not one of the\nother barbaric louts.
50040#Perhaps you've already heard, but there's another\nblacksmith at the entrance of Stonefang mine.
50041#He's an eccentric old man, but he knows his trade well. \nHe's the only sane one left in a town of soul-starved men.
50042#If you do meet him... Yeah... well, forget it, \nthat stubborn old n'er do well will just ignore you...
50050#There aren't enough blacksmiths \nin this temple to handle all the work.
50051#Only certain ores can be used to forge weapons, \nbut you'll just have to make do.
50052#And be thankful that I'm still of good health.
50070#Well, old Ed's still up to his old strange ways, is he?
50071#Hah hah, even the Demons don't know what to\ndo with him, hmm?
50072#Gawd, my sides ache! Hah hah hah hah...
50080#Deep inside Stonefang mine is \nan ancient dragon burial ground.
50081#The bones of the dragons exude ore.
50090#Back in my younger years, I had the strength of an ox.
50091#The miners would always ask me to clear out the bearbugs, \nwhich I pummelled with my bare hands!
50092#But even I couldn't beat 'em. \nSo I lobbed them into the lava pits!
50093#Gah hah hah hah hah!
50100#I'm pretty strong myself, \nbut even I don't compare to old Ed.
50101#The man's a beast, I tell you! The man must eat\ndragon tails and wishing stones.
50102#If you heed my advice, you'll avoid crossing him.
50103#I reckon he'd prove a lot more trouble than most Demons!
50104#Gah hah hah hah hah!
50110#What in blazes do you think you're doing!?
50111#Have you lost your wretched senses?
50112#I am Boldwin, and I am not going down without a fight!
